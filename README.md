This code is a simple security tool to perform various types of scans. When executed, it presents a menu of different scan options, including:

    Scan for vulnerable printers:
    This option scans for printers that are running on port 9100 and may be vulnerable to exploitation.

    Scan for Eternal Blue:
    This option scans for hosts that have open port 445, which is a common port for the EternalBlue exploit.

    Scan for passwordless SSH services:
    This option scans for hosts that have open port 22 and may be running passwordless SSH services.

    Nmap fingerprint:
    This option performs an Nmap OS fingerprinting scan, which identifies the operating system running on a device. You will be prompted to enter a domain name for the scan.

    Nmap subdomain enumeration:
    This option performs an Nmap subdomain enumeration scan, which lists all the subdomains of a given domain. You will be prompted to enter a domain name for the scan.

    Nmap exif data spider:
    This option performs an Nmap Exif data spider scan, which extracts metadata from image files that are accessible via HTTP on a given domain. You will be prompted to enter a domain name for the scan.

    Quit:
    This option allows you to exit the program.

The user selects a scan option by entering a number, and the appropriate scan is executed. The results of the scan are displayed on the screen. The code makes use of several libraries, including os, sys, and subprocess. The code also uses the masscan and nmap tools to perform the scans.
